- Use your tool to measure the  number of instructions that are require to execute your implementation of the guessing game program that you implemented in homework 1 using two different levels of optimization:

  - When your program is compiled using the -O0 flag:

    ```
    171 instructions with 260 cycles
    ```

  - When your program is compiled using the -O3 flag:

    ```
    112 instructions with 180 cycles
    ```

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

### Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
