# Homework

This is the starting readme for this assignment.  Please edit the following information by removing the "*edit me*" and replace it with appropriate information for your assignment. If it is asking you a question, please provide a response.

- Name: Alan Garcia
- Description: This is double linked list implementation.
- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? 12
- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.
  - no
- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)
  - I in this assignment I did not use any.
- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
  - Implementing this was very fun, I often had to figure out steps that I missed.
- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 
  - Testing in gradescope often confuses me greatly. For example I added a printf("%d", pos) of the argument pos in insert_dll(), it made all the related tests fail. Futhermore, sometimes I got the correct output but my test fails either way. (I was using my print_dll tool.)
  - If it's possible please add an Expected:X Actual:Y type of statement.

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

### Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
